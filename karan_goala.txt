Hello World! I am Karan Goala.
<p>I am currently a final year electrical engineering student of National Institute of technology, Silchar.</p>
<p> I am usually found near a computer or any electronic gadget which has broken down. Apart from all the geeky stuff, I love playing soccer(not video game) and clicking pictures of the natural sceneries in my campus.</p>
<p> I can write code in C++, JavaScript, python and 8085 assembly language. My code can be found on my GitHub page (link is provided below). I have also worked with MATLAB and Simulink. I am passionate about solving programming challenges and building electronic projects. So far, I have done a number of personal projects which were mostly electronics based. I have worked with arduino, esp8266 and basic electronic components. Currently, I am working on a few projects which include web-apps.<br>
